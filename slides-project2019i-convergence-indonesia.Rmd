## Motivation:

- Economic convergence is important for regional cohesion and competitiveness

- Regional income disparities are a pervasive feature of Indonesia (Esmara 1975; Mishra 2009; Bendesa et al 2016)

- Improvements in labor productivity (and its determinants) may help reduce regional income disparities

  
## Research Objective:
  
- Study the evolution of regional disparities in labor productivity, capital accumulation, and efﬁciency across Indonesian provinces with a particular emphasis on the formation of local convergence clubs

  - Labor productivity = F(Physical capital, Human capital, Efficiency)

  
## Methods:

- Nonlinear dynamic factor model  (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)
- Clustering algorithm for panel data (Phillips and Sul, 2007, 2009)

## Data:

- Labor productivity, phyical capital, human capital, efficiency (Katoka, 2013,2018)
- 26 Indonesian provinces over the 1990-2010 period

## Main Results:

1. Cross-provincial dynamics of labor productivity are characterized by **TWO convergence clubs**

2. The dynamics of the proximate determinants of labor productivity show some mixed results:

  - Physical and human capital are characterized by **multiple convergence clubs** (FOUR and TWO convergence clubs, respectively)
  - Two alternative measures of efficiency are characterized by **ONE convergence club**

# Convergence framework (brief overview)

- First, define a relative transition parameter, $h_{it}$, as

$$h_{it}=\frac{y_{it}}{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{it}}$$

- Second, the convergence hypothesis is defined as

$$H_{t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(h_{it}-1\right)^{2}\rightarrow 0$$

In other words, when the relative transition parameter converges to unity, $h_{it}\rightarrow1$, the cross-sectional variance converges to zero, $H_{t}\rightarrow0$.


- Thrid, Phillips and Sul (2007) test this hypothesis by using the following log t regression model

$$log\left(\frac{H_{1}}{H_{t}} \right)-2log\left\{ log\left(t\right)\right\}  =  a+b\:log\left(t\right)+\epsilon_{t}$$

# Concluding Remarks


- Reject the (overall) convergence hypothesis in labor productivity and two of its determinants: physical capital and human capital
  - Physical capital: Four clubs with separating trends at the extremes
  - Human capital: Two clubs with serating trends

- A unique convergence club in efficiency
  - Low effeciency club: Is this a low efficiency trap?

## Implications, discussion, and further research

- Regional heterogeneity is a pervasive feature in Indonesia (and many developing countries)
  - The need for an analaytical framework that focuses on heterogeneity and goes beyond the average

- Convergence clubs may help us identify economies facing similar challenges
  - Call for better coordination and cooperation policies both within and between clubs

- Masked within provinces in Indonesia, there is still a high degree of heterogeneity that is worth exploring. Using district level data is the next step.
